# Examples

This directory contains runnable demos and utilities.

## Streamlit Demo

Run the HealthCheck AI medical assistant chatbot that showcases the three agents (Security, Context, Model Selection):

```bash
streamlit run examples/streamlit_demo.py
```

- Medical assistant for health information, symptom analysis, and wellness guidance
- Shows per-agent insights, costs, and tokens
- Short-circuits unsafe inputs
- Uses JSON-mode responses for reliable parsing
- ⚠️ Not a substitute for professional medical advice

## Smoke Test (CLI)

Quickly exercise all agents and verify LLM calls:

```bash
python examples/agent_smoke_test.py
```

## Evaluation (Batch)

Run large-scale evaluations using a JSONL dataset.

```bash
python examples/eval_agents.py --data examples/data/sample_eval.jsonl --agent all --max 1000 --concurrency 4 --report eval_report.json
```

Options:
- `--agent`: one of `all`, `security`, `context`, `model_selection`
- `--max`: limit items (0 = all)
- `--concurrency`: threads for parallel execution
- `--report`: write a JSON report with summary and sample failures
- `--dry-run`: validate dataset only (no API calls)

Dataset schema (JSONL, one per line):

```json
{"agent": "security", "input": "...", "expected": {"blocked": true, "category": "sexual"}}
{"agent": "context", "input": "...", "expected": {"is_contextual": false, "min_relevance": 0.6}}
{"agent": "model_selection", "input": "...", "expected": {"selected_in": ["gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4o-mini"]}}
```

Recommendation threshold: if overall failure rate ≥ 10%, prompts/configs should be upgraded.

- Security metrics are populated per-response (1.0 for detected categories; 0.0 otherwise).
